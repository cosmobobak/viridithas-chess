You must make your choice. Either this man was and is the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. 

You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as  a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. 

But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. 

He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.

What a man believes upon grossly insufficient evidence is an index into his desires - desires of which he himself is often unconscious. If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it. 

If, on the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept it even on the slightest evidence.

One day a group of Darwinian scientists got together and decided that man had come a long way and no longer needed God. 

So they picked one Darwinian to go and tell Him that they were done with Him. The Darwinian walked up to God and said, God, we've decided that we no longer need you. We're to the point that we can clone people and do many miraculous things, so why don't you just go on and get lost. 

God listened very patiently and kindly to the man. After the Darwinian was done talking, God said, Very well, how about this? Let's say we have a man-making contest. To which the Darwinian happily agreed. God added, Now, we're going to do this just like I did back in the old days with Adam. 

The Darwinian said, Sure, no problem and bent down and grabbed himself a handful of dirt. 

God looked at him and said, No, no, no. You go get your own dirt!!!!

I was shocked, confused, bewildered as I entered Heaven's door, Not by the beauty of it all, nor the lights or its decor. 

But it was the folks in Heaven who made me sputter and gasp­ The thieves, the liars, the sinners, the alcoholics and the trash. 

There stood the kid from seventh grade who swiped my lunch money twice. Next to him was my old neighbor who never said anything nice. 

Herb, who I always thought was rotting away in hell, was sitting pretty on cloud nine, looking incredibly well. 

I nudged Jesus, What's the deal? I would love to hear your take. How'd all these sinners get up here? God must've made a mistake. And why's everyone so quiet, so somber ­ give me a clue. 

Child,' He said, 'they're all in shock. They never thought they'd be seeing you!

Once we see, however, that the probability of life originating at random is so utterly minuscule as to make it absurd, it becomes sensible to think that the favourable properties of physics on which life depends are in every respect deliberate....

It is therefore almost inevitable that our own measure of intelligence must reflect ... higher intelligences ...even to the limit of God... such a theory is so obvious that one wonders why it is not widely accepted as being self-evident. The reasons are psychological rather than scientific.

The human genome is made up of DNA, which has four different chemical building blocks. These are called bases and abbreviated A, T, C, and G.

In the human genome, about 3 billion bases are arranged along the chromosomes in a particular order for each unique individual. 

To get an idea of the size of the human genome present in each of our cells, consider the following analogy: 

If the DNA sequence of the human genome were compiled in books, the equivalent of 200 volumes the size of a Manhattan telephone book (at 1000 pages each) would be needed to hold it all.

If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
 
And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 
 
If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.  
 
Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. 
 
Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.  
 
Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away. 
 
For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. 
 
When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. 
 
For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.

So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.

The Parable of the Lost Sheep

Now the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him [Jesus]. 

And the Pharisees and the scribes grumbled, saying, This man receives sinners and eats with them.  

So he [Jesus] told them this parable: 

What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the open country, and go after the one that is lost, until he finds it? 

And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 

And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost. 

Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous persons who need no repentance.

God's Everlasting Love 

What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 

He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? 

Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is to condemn? 

Christ Jesus is the one who died-more than that, who was raised-who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us. 

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? 

Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? 36 As it is written, “For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.” 

No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 

For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

The fine-tuned universal constants.

There are 43 of such physical constants in the Universe and if you change just one of them too much life would be impossible.

The chance these 43 universal physical constants developed itself (randomly) by chance is astronomic low. 

One part in 10^37 is such an incredibly sensitive balance that it is hard to visualize. 

The following analogy might help: Cover the entire North American continent in dimes all the way up to the moon, a height of about 239,000 miles (In comparison, the money to pay for the U.S. federal government debt would cover one square mile less than two feet deep with dimes.)

Next, pile dimes from here to the moon on a billion other continents the same size as North America. 

Paint one dime red and mix it into the billions of piles of dimes. 

Blindfold a friend and ask him to pick out one dime. 

The odds that he will pick the red dime are one in 10^37.
